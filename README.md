# Real-World Algorithms Visualizations

## Overview
This repository contains visualizations of multiple complex algorithms that I created as part of my Real-World Algorithms class, using the **Bridges API**. The visualizers demonstrate how various algorithms work in practice, providing an interactive and visual approach to understanding their behavior and performance. You can explore the visualizations at [Bridges-CS](https://bridges-cs.herokuapp.com/username/amanw).

## Algorithms Covered
Throughout the course, I implemented and visualized the following algorithms:

### 1. **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(N log N).
- **Quicksort**: Another efficient sorting algorithm that works by partitioning the array and sorting the partitions recursively.

### 2. **Graph Representation and Traversals**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the present depth before moving to nodes at the next depth level.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Application**: Implemented BFS to compute Bacon numbers and explored graph representation using adjacency lists and matrices.

### 3. **Graph Algorithms**
- **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
- **Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Computes the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
- **Projects**: Applied shortest path analysis on OpenStreetMap data and extracted centerlines from tubular structures using MST.

### 4. **String Matching**
- **Horspool's Algorithm**: An efficient string matching algorithm used in gene sequence alignment projects, enabling both global and local alignment.

### 5. **Searching and Indexing**
- **Binary Search**: A logarithmic time search algorithm for finding elements in a sorted array.
- **PageRank**: Implemented a PageRank algorithm using Wikipedia actor/movie data for indexing and ranking web pages.
- **Spatial Search Trees**: Explored spatial data structures like Quadtrees.

### 6. **Other Algorithms**
- **Traveling Salesman Problem**: Used Primâ€™s MST to approximate the traveling salesman tour of US cities.
- **Knapsack Problem**: Applied dynamic programming techniques to solve this optimization problem.

## Projects and Visualizers
Each of the above algorithms was implemented and visualized using the **Bridges API**. The visualizers can be explored via the [Bridges-CS platform](https://bridges-cs.herokuapp.com/username/amanw). These projects demonstrate the real-world application of complex algorithms and provide an intuitive understanding of their execution.

### Projects:
- **BFS and DFS Traversal Visualizer**
